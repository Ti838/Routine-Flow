# Gradient Flow UI - Design System

The official UI/UX design documentation for "Routine Flow".

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The "Gradient Flow" design system focuses on **Vibrant Modernity**, **Glassmorphism**, and **Fluid Transitions**. It is designed to feel alive, premium, and efficient, ensuring that academic scheduling is not just functional but also visually empowering.

## 🌑 Dark Mode: "Cosmic Glow"

- **Background**: `#0B1121` (Deep Space Blue)
- **Cards**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` (Frosted Glass)
- **Accent**: Indigo/Purple Gradients
- **Typography**: Pure White and High-Contrast Grays

## ☀️ Light Mode: "Cloud Breeze"

- **Background**: `#F9FAFB` (Soft Gray)
- **Cards**: Pure White with subtle Indigo shadows
- **Accent**: Royal Blue/Indigo Gradients
- **Typography**: Deep Slate and Muted Grays

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Premium Cards (`.card-premium`)

Used for statistics and content blocks.

- **Visuals**: Large border-radius (40px or 48px), subtle borders, and soft shadows.
- **Glassmorphism**: Backdrop blur used in dark mode for extra depth.

### 2. Interactive Inputs (`.field-wrapper`)

- **Animation**: Floating labels that move up on focus or when data is present.
- **Validation**: Bottom-border transition from gray to primary indigo.

### 3. Iconic Branding

- **Logo**: 16px to 64px `favicon.png` with a gradient pulse effect.
- **Typography**: `Inter` font family (300 to 900 weight).

## ⚡ Animation Library

- **Fade In**: Smooth entry for hero sections and cards.
- **Floating**: Gentle vertical oscillation for preview elements.
- **Hover Scale**: Subtle `scale(1.02)` or `scale(1.05)` on buttons and cards to provide tactile feedback.
